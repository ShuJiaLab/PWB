# PWB
This is the code for patch-wise Wiener–Butterworth deconvolution (PWB). 

In the file "Utils", the main code is "PWB.m". 

All the parameters we used are already preset in the code. If you want to use this code on your own data, feel free to tune the parameters.

We acknowledge the work "Rapid image deconvolution and multiview fusion for optical microscopy" on Nature Biotechnology and "Patch deconvolution for Fourier light-field microscopy" on Biophysical Journal, as we adotped some of the methods in their paper. 

We have only provided the reconstruction code. If you want the hPSF and FLFM image data, please contact hwu648@gatech.edu.
