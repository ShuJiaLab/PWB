# PWB
This is the code for patch-wise Wiener–Butterworth deconvolution (PWB). 

In the file "Utils", the main code is "PWB.m". 

All the parameters we used are already preset in the code. If you want to use this code on your own data, feel free to tune the parameters.

We acknowledge the work "Rapid image deconvolution and multiview fusion for optical microscopy" on Nature Biotechnology and "Patch deconvolution for Fourier light-field microscopy" on Biophysical Journal, as we adotped some of the methods in their paper. 

The hybrid-PSF and FLFM image data of HeLa cells are uploaded to
https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.31400772
You can try to use the PWB deconvolution to reconstruct the HeLa cells.
